### Hi there ðŸ©°
Welcome to this page, where all the baby steps of mine was kept â™¡

I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science in NYCU(NCTU), who chose CS by accident and struggled. But found joy and happiness from achievements and precious friendships I've earned. I regard the little accident as a gift from life, which you only have once, and is our duty to live it as fully as possible.

Aside from schoolwork, I also enjoy ballet, movies and writing.
